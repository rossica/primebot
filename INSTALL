Installation For Linux:
    Use your distro's package manager to make sure you have GMP installed.
    Then run `make` or `make debug` if you're going to do development.
    You're all set!

Installation For Windows:
Windows 64-bit:
    Follow the instructions here for installing MinGW-w64 and MSYS
    http://rperki.blogspot.com/2015/05/installing-mingw-w64-msys-on-win-81-x64.html

    Then, follow the instructions here for MS Windows DLLs (but you're going to build a static lib):
    https://gmplib.org/manual/Notes-for-Particular-Systems.html#Notes-for-Particular-Systems

    Summarized:
    Open MSYS console, navigate to where you have GMP source extracted (e.g. /c/gmp/)
    (update the prefix below with the path to where you cloned primebot)
    Run:
    ./configure --prefix=/c/primebot --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --enable-static --disable-shared --enable-cxx

    Now run:
    `make -j8`
    `make check -j8`
    `make install`

    Next, copy libgcc.a from the mingw-w64 installation directory into the
    primebot/lib folder. This will enable visual studio to link the static lib
    successfully.

    The problem is __chkstk_ms, which is emitted by GCC, is not available on
    Windows, so we must link against Mingw-W64's libgcc to get it.

Windows 32-bit:
    Why are you doing this? :)
